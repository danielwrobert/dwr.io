When developing a responsively designed web site, it is likely that you will come across a situation where you will want to selectively execute a JavaScript callback based on a [media query](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/CSS/Media_queries "Media Queries") comparison. For example, you may want to alter your menu layout for small-screen devices. Or you may wish to load in specific content only on large-screen devices. Luckily, these capabilities are currently available. In this article I will cover a couple methods and show you that this can be done without much trouble at all!

### window.matchMedia()

`window.matchMedia()` is a very convenient, native JavaScript method that allows you to check for a match against a CSS media query condition. As [MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/DOM/window.matchMedia "MDN") states, it “returns a new `MediaQueryList` object representing the parsed results of the specified media query string”.

In other words, by simply wrapping a media query in a `matchMedia` check you are able to execute conditional, view port specific JavaScript code contingent upon wether or not that check returns a match:

```javascript
if (window.matchMedia("(min-width: 72em)").matches) {
// Code executed only if view port is >= 72em
} else {
// Code executed if view port is < 72em
}
```

The `matchMedia()` method is natively supported in Chrome, Firefox 9+, Safari 5.1+, iOS5+ and Android 3+. For browsers that do not support the method, an excellent polyfill created by Paul Irish, Nicholas Zakas and Scott Jehl is available on [GitHub](https://github.com/paulirish/matchMedia.js "matchMedia.js polyfill").

### Enquire.js

[Enquire.js](http://alpha.responsivedesign.is/resources/javascript-and-jquery/enquire.js "Enquire.js") is a lightweight JavaScript library that relies on the previously mentioned native `window.matchMedia()` API. In addition to the functionality provided with the native matchMedia() method, Enquire.js offers some additional capabilities for running media query matches. To list a few:

- The ability to execute callbacks as media queries are both matched and unmatched, based on browser resize and orientation change events
- Run one-time setup callbacks
- Unregister a handler, or group of handlers, to perform any necessary cleanup
- Support for multiple handlers per media query
- Chain multiple media queries together to be registered with `enquire`

Since this library is based on window.matchMedia(), you will also need to utilize the aforementioned polyfill if you want to support older browsers. While I haven’t *yet* used Enquire.js in a production setting, I still think it would definitely be worth your while to give it a look!
