When debugging in JavaScript, browser extenstions can be a potential source of confusion. At the very least, they may add additional noise to the process.

In order to make sure you're not dealing with any extra code outside of your application, you can use [Incognito Mode to browse in private](https://support.google.com/chrome/answer/95464).

This disables all of your extensions and ensures that you are able to focus only on the code at hand.

If you have explicitly set some of your extenstions to be [available in Incognito Mode](https://www.howtogeek.com/298407/how-to-enable-extensions-in-chromes-incognito-mode/) for one reason or another, you may want to consider disabling those temporarily, while debugging.
